At its heart, the combined approach simply asks two questions in sequence:

---

### 1. Has the stock been “coiling” in low volatility?

* **Why?**  Periods of very tight trading ranges (“squeezes” or “coils”) often precede big moves—price is like a compressed spring.
* **How?**  We look at the average daily range (High–Low) over a short window (say 10 days) and compare it to its own historical distribution (over, say, 50 days).  If today’s recent average range is in the bottom 30% of that longer history, we say “yes, it’s consolidating.”

---

### 2. Has price “zoomed” decisively out of that coil?

* **Why?**  A true breakout isn’t just poking its head above the coil; it’s a clear jump into a new price zone—often on the back of fresh catalysts (earnings, news, upgrades).
* **How?**  We take the highest close of that same coil period (the top of the compressed range) and ask whether today’s close is at least *X*% above it (for example, +10%).  If yes, that’s a “zoom breakout.”

---

### Putting them together

We **only** flag days that pass **both** tests:

1. **Low‐volatility coil** → the stock’s been grinding in a tight range.
2. **Zoom breakout** → today’s close blasts at least *X*% above that entire coil high.

---

### Why this is powerful

* **Filters noise:**  Random spikes that happen during choppy, high‐volatility environments get filtered out—they aren’t coming from a true coil.
* **Captures momentum:**  Only the moves that “spring out” with real conviction (big % jump) make the list.

In practice, you sweep your universe with these two simple but complementary filters to highlight the most structurally promising breakouts—those that start from a base of quiet consolidation and then leap into a new trading zone.

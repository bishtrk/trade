Not every MACD-signal crossover is a green light. When MACD is oscillating around zero in a choppy market, you’ll get lots of “false” crossovers (whipsaws). Here’s how to filter them down to the high-probability ones:

---

### 1. Use a Trend Filter

* **Price above/below a key MA** (e.g. 200-day SMA):

  * Only take **bullish** MACD crossovers when price is above your long-term MA.
  * Only take **bearish** crossovers when price is below it.
* This keeps you in the direction of the broader trend and ignores counter-trend whipsaws.

### 2. Zero-Line Confirmation

* **Stronger signals** occur when the crossover happens **on the same side** of zero as your bias:

  * A bullish crossover **above** the zero line
  * A bearish crossover **below** zero
* Crossovers right around zero are weaker and prone to failure.

### 3. Require Momentum “Punch”

* Look at the **MACD histogram**: wait for it to expand a little (e.g. histogram bars > 0.5× recent average) before you pull the trigger.
* This ensures that momentum is picking up, not just flickering.

### 4. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

* If you trade the hourly chart, first confirm the same MACD crossover on the 4-hour (or daily) chart.
* This reduces noise and keeps you aligned with higher-time-frame momentum.

### 5. Volume or ATR Filter

* **Volume spike** on the crossover candle adds conviction.
* Or require that the price move from crossover to entry exceeds **1–1.5× ATR**—so you’re not trading micro-ranges.

### 6. Combine with Price Action

* Wait for a clean break of a **support/resistance** level or a **swing high/low** in the direction of the MACD signal.
* A MACD crossover plus a fresh higher low (for longs) or lower high (for shorts) makes for a much tighter, more reliable entry.

#### **Bottom Line**

• **Don’t trade every single crossover**—that’s a recipe for small losses adding up.
• **Layer in one or two filters** (trend, zero-line, histogram strength) and you’ll whittle out most of the noise while capturing the true momentum moves.

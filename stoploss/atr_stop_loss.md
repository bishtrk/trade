**ATR-based Stop Loss** is all about matching your stop to the stock’s natural “noise” level rather than an arbitrary percentage or chart point. Here’s how it works:

---

### 1. **What Is ATR?**

* **True Range (TR)** for each bar is the greatest of:

  * High − Low
  * |High − Previous Close|
  * |Low − Previous Close|
* **Average True Range (ATR)** is simply the N-period rolling average of TR (commonly N = 14).

ATR tells you, on average, how much the stock moves in a bar. A high ATR means big swings; a low ATR means small ones.

---

### 2. **Why Use It for Stops?**

* **Adaptive Buffer**

  * Volatile stocks (high ATR) need wider stops so normal swings don’t knock you out.
  * Quiet stocks (low ATR) can use tighter stops without risk of noise.
* **Objective & Consistent**

  * Not subject to the trader’s eyeballing of trend lines or percentages.
  * Same rule applies to any symbol or time frame.

---

### 3. **The Formula**

$$
\text{Stop Loss} = \text{Entry Price} \;-\; (\text{Multiplier}\;\times\;\text{ATR})
$$

* **Multiplier** is your “breathing room” factor—common choices:

  * 1.5×ATR for moderately tight stops
  * 2.0×ATR or more for very volatile names

### 4. **Example**

| Parameter    | Value  |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Entry Price  | ₹1 000 |
| ATR (14-day) | ₹20    |
| Multiplier   | 2.0    |

$$
\text{Stop} = 1000 - (2 \times 20) = 1000 - 40 = \mathbf{₹960}
$$

Your stop sits at ₹960—40 points below entry, precisely calibrated to two days’ average movement.

### 5. **Pros & Cons**

| Pros                                       | Cons                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Automatically scales to current volatility | Doesn’t consider chart-based support levels  |
| Simple, formulaic, easy to backtest        | May place stops “in the air” if ATR spikes   |
| Works on any time frame or asset           | Requires a clean ATR series (watch for gaps) |

---

### 6. **When to Use**

* **On a “blind” entry**: if you jump in at market without chart prep.
* **As a first-cut protective stop**: then refine with a support-based stop once you can see the chart.
* **In systematic strategies**: where you need fully quantitative rules.

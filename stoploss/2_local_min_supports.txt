Yes—using **local minima** to define support is a perfectly valid (and often more nuanced) alternative to simply taking the lowest prior low. Here’s how the two approaches differ and what each “buys” you:

---

## 1. Rolling Min Support (Your Original Method)

1. **Definition**

   * Support = the lowest Low over the last *N* days (e.g. a 10-day rolling min).
2. **Pros**

   * **Guarantees** you pick the absolute trough in your look-back window.
   * Easy to compute with `rolling(window).min()`.
3. **Cons**

   * Often picks a **single extreme outlier** candle—may be driven by a flash‐crash wick rather than true buying interest.
   * Ignores whether that low was “respected” (i.e. price came back up and traded around it) multiple times.

---

## 2. Local Minima Clustering (The “Multiple Dip” Method)

1. **Definition**

   * A **local minimum** is any bar whose Low is lower than its immediate neighbors (e.g. lower than the 2 bars on each side in a 5-bar window).
   * A **support zone** is then formed by clustering those local minima that fall within a small price band (e.g. ±0.5% of each other).
2. **Pros**

   * **Filters out one-off spikes**—only true “dips” where price reversed in the next bar qualify.
   * **Identifies zones** where multiple dips cluster, which often become stronger support levels.
3. **Cons**

   * Requires two steps—(a) detect minima, then (b) cluster them—so it’s a bit more code.
   * You need to choose:

     * The **neighborhood size** (how many bars on each side to compare)
     * The **clustering tolerance** (how tight the price bands must be to count as the same zone)

### When to Use Which

| Scenario                                | Rolling Min                       | Local Minima Clustering            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| You need a “hard” stop level fast       | ✔️ quick & easy                   | ❌ more setup                       |
| You want to avoid single-wick anomalies | ❌ may pick the single lowest wick | ✔️ ignores one-bar spikes          |
| You value **zone** over exact price     | ❌ gives one precise price         | ✔️ gives a band of likely support  |
| You may backtest dozens of symbols      | ✔️ lightning-fast in pure Pandas  | ❌ slightly more compute per symbol |

### In Practice

1. **Rolling Min**:

   ```python
   support = df['Low'].shift(1).rolling(window=10).min()
   stop = support - buffer
   ```

2. **Local Minima**:

   * **Detect minima**: a bar *i* is a local min if

     ```
     Low[i] < Low[i-2], Low[i-1]  
     AND  
     Low[i] < Low[i+1], Low[i+2]
     ```
   * **Cluster** all those Low\[i] values into price bands (e.g. round to nearest ₹5 or ±0.5%).
   * **Support zone** = the most recent cluster’s band.

Both methods are valid—**rolling min** is great for speed and simplicity, **local minima clustering** is stronger for noise-resistant, zone-based support levels. Choose based on how precise and robust you need your stop‐level construction to be.

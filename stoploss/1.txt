hwo about:  Quick Checklist to Pick Your Stop Loss:
Check the low of the breakout day—most commonly used.
Look for nearest support zone on chart.
Set your stop slightly below (not exactly at) that level.
Adjust for stock’s volatility—avoid too tight stops.
Re-evaluate after each new move, especially in high-volatility periods.


That’s a great, concise framework. Here’s a polished “Quick-Stop Checklist” you can apply to TCS (or any other instrument):

1. **Identify the Breakout Low/High**

   * For a long, mark the **low of the breakout candle**; for a short, the **high of the breakdown candle**.
   * This is often the “trigger” level that shifted supply/demand.

2. **Locate the Nearest Support/Resistance Zone**

   * Zoom out slightly and find the last cluster of swing lows (for longs) or swing highs (for shorts).
   * Draw a horizontal band rather than a single line—this accounts for minor intraday wicks.

3. **Add a Buffer Below/Above the Zone**

   * Never place the stop exactly on the level.
   * Use a small offset (e.g., 0.5–1% of price, or a few ticks) to avoid getting whipsawed by noise.

4. **Adjust for Volatility**

   * Check TCS’s recent **ATR** (say 14-day).
   * Ensure your buffer is at least **1×ATR** away from your entry to give the trade breathing room.

5. **Re-Evaluate Dynamically**

   * After every significant swing or volatility expansion, **re-draw** your support/resistance bands.
   * If price makes a higher low (for longs) or lower high (for shorts), consider **trailing** your stop to that new structure.

6. **Mind Your Risk Budget**

   * Calculate the distance from entry to your stop in ₹ and ensure it fits your **max‐loss** per trade (e.g. 1–2% of equity).
   * If the structural stop is too far (risk > your limit), either pass on the trade or reduce position size.

By following these steps—anchoring stops to chart structure, buffering for noise, and adapting with volatility—you’ll build a robust, repeatable stop-loss process.

### How it works

1. **ATR Calculation**

   * Uses True Range (max of three measures) and a 14-day rolling average.

2. **Breakout Detection**

   * Marks days where `Close` > highest `High` of the previous 20 days.

3. **Support Zone**

   * Takes the lowest `Low` over the prior 10 days.

4. **Buffer**

   * Chooses the larger of 0.5% of the Close price (you can tweak `buffer_pct`) and the current ATR.

5. **Stop Price**

   * Sets `StopPrice = Support – Buffer`.

6. **Filtering**

   * Outputs only the rows for detected breakout days, with columns:
     `Close` (entry proxy), `Low` (breakout day low), `Support`, `ATR`, `Buffer`, and the final `StopPrice`.

#### Usage

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
python stop_losses_tcs.py
```

You can adjust:

* `breakout_lookback` → how many days to look back for your breakout high.
* `support_window`     → how many days to scan for your support low.
* `buffer_pct`         → your fixed % buffer (e.g. 0.005 = 0.5%).
* `atr_period`         → ATR look-back.

This will give you a clear, reproducible stop-loss level for each breakout per your checklist.

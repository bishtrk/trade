Here’s how you move from “bet‐the‐farm” all‐in bets to a more professional, risk-controlled approach:

---

## 1. Fixed-Fraction Position Sizing

* **What it is**: You decide up-front to risk a fixed percentage of your current equity on each trade (e.g. 2%).
* **How it works**:

  1. Determine your stop-loss distance in price points (or %).
  2. Calculate position size = (Equity × Risk %) / (stop distance).
* **Why it matters**: Keeps your drawdowns predictable—a string of losers will only ever cost you that fixed percentage per trade.

---

## 2. Kelly Criterion

* **What it is**: A mathematically optimal fraction of your bankroll to risk, based on your edge and win/loss odds.
* **Core idea**:

  $$
    f^* = W - \frac{1-W}{R}
  $$

  where *W* = probability of a winning trade, *R* = average win ÷ average loss.
* **Pros & cons**:

  * **Pro**: Maximizes long-run growth.
  * **Con**: Very aggressive—can lead to large drawdowns if your edge estimates are off.
* **Typical use**: Traders often use a “fractional Kelly” (e.g. ¼ Kelly) to damp volatility.

## 3. ATR-Based Stops

* **What it is**: Use the Average True Range (ATR) to size your stop-loss dynamically to current volatility.
* **How it works**:

  * Compute ATR over *N* periods (e.g. 14-day).
  * Place your stop *k*×ATR away from your entry (e.g. 1.5 ATR).
* **Why**: In calm markets your stop is tighter; in choppier markets it widens to avoid getting whipsawed.

## 4. Stop-Loss & Take-Profit Orders

* **Stop-Loss**: An order to exit automatically if the market moves against you by a pre-defined amount.
* **Take-Profit**: An order to exit once you’ve achieved a target gain.
* **Key points**:

  * Define your risk-reward ratio up-front (e.g. 1:2 or 1:3).
  * Always place your stop at the same time as your entry to avoid emotional “stop-moving.”
  * Consider trailing stops (locking in profits as the trend progresses).

---

## 5. Portfolio Diversification

* **What it is**: Splitting capital across multiple, ideally uncorrelated, instruments.
* **Benefits**:

  * Reduces the impact of a single bad signal.
  * Smooths out the equity curve.
* **Implementation tips**:

  * Cap maximum allocation per symbol or sector (e.g. no more than 25% in one stock).
  * Consider correlations: pick instruments that don’t always move together.

## Milestone: 2%-of-Equity Risk Rule

1. **Define**: You will never risk more than 2% of your current account on any single trade.
2. **Procedure**:

   * On each buy signal, compute your stop price (e.g. entry – 1.5 ATR).
   * Calculate risk per share = entry price – stop price.
   * Position size = (Equity × 0.02) / (risk per share).
3. **Backtest impact**:

   * Track how your position sizes shrink on big drawdowns and grow on winning streaks.
   * Observe your max drawdown vs. “all-in” backtest—should be substantially lower.
4. **Next step**: Add this sizing logic into your backtest loop and compare equity curves & drawdowns with and without the 2% rule.

By layering fixed-fraction sizing, ATR-based stops, and sensible portfolio limits, you turn your SMA crossover from a blunt instrument into a disciplined, scalable strategy.

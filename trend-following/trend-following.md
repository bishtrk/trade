### **1. Classic Turtle Trading System**  
- **Core Idea**: Enter trades when prices break out of predefined channels (e.g., 20-day highs/lows) and exit when the trend reverses (e.g., 10-day lows for long positions) .  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Position Sizing**: Uses Average True Range (ATR) to adjust trade size based on volatility.  
  - **Pyramiding**: Adds to winning positions as the trend strengthens .  
  - **Risk Management**: Fixed percentage of capital risked per trade (typically 1–2%) .  

---

### **2. Moving Average-Based Strategies**  
- **Dual Moving Average (DMA)**:  
  - Enter long when a shorter MA (e.g., 100-day) crosses above a longer MA (e.g., 350-day); short on the opposite crossover .  
  - **Performance**: Backtests show ~57.8% CAGR but with 31.8% max drawdown .  
- **Triple Moving Average (TMA)**:  
  - Adds a trend filter (e.g., 350-day MA) to confirm trades only when shorter MAs align with the long-term trend .

### **3. Channel Breakout Systems**  
- **ATR Channel Breakout**:  
  - Buy/sell when price closes above/below a channel formed by ±3–7 ATR around a 350-day MA .  
  - **Performance**: 49.5% CAGR, 39.9% drawdown in commodities .  
- **Bollinger Band Breakout**:  
  - Entries triggered when price crosses bands set at 2.5 standard deviations from a 350-day MA .

### **4. Donchian Trend Strategy**  
- **Rules**:  
  - **Trend Filter**: 25-day EMA must be above 350-day MA for long entries.  
  - **Entry**: New 20-day high/low triggers trades.  
  - **Exit**: 2x ATR stop-loss or time-based exit (e.g., 80 days) .  
- **Performance**: 29.4% CAGR (standard) vs. 57.2% CAGR with time exits .  

---

### **5. Multi-Indicator Approaches**  
- **MACD + RSI**:  
  - Use MACD crossovers for trend direction and RSI (>70/<30) to confirm overbought/oversold conditions .  
- **ADX for Trend Strength**:  
  - ADX >25 confirms strong trends; combined with moving averages for entries .  
- **Bollinger Bands + Momentum**:  
  - Trade breakouts from bands during high volatility, confirmed by RSI or volume .  

---

### **6. Advanced Tactics**  
- **Timeframe Diversification**: Combine fast (short-term) and slow (long-term) trend models to adapt to market conditions .  
- **Convexity Exploitation**: Trend-following thrives during extreme market moves (e.g., crises), providing "crisis alpha" .  

---

### **Key Considerations**  
- **Risk Management**: Always use stop-losses (e.g., ATR-based) and reduce position sizes during drawdowns .  
- **Diversification**: Trade across uncorrelated assets (commodities, currencies, bonds) to smooth returns .  
- **Psychological Discipline**: Accept high drawdowns (30–40%) and low win rates (30–40%) as part of the strategy .

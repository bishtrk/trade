| Strategy                             | Core Idea                                                                                                                      | Typical Parameters                    | Pros                                                    | Cons                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SMA Crossover**                    | Go long when a short SMA (e.g. 50) crosses above a long SMA (e.g. 200), and vice versa for shorts.                             | Short SMA period, Long SMA period     | Very simple to code and understand.                     | Late signals in choppy markets.                        |
| **EMA Crossover**                    | Same as SMA crossover but using EMAs, which weight recent prices more heavily.                                                 | Short EMA period, Long EMA period     | Faster reaction to new trends vs. SMA.                  | Can whipsaw more in sideways markets.                  |
| **Donchian Channel Breakout**        | Buy when price closes above the highest high of the past N days; sell on break below lowest low.                               | Channel length N                      | Captures strong breakouts, clear stops.                 | Gives false-break signals in low volatility.           |
| **Time-Series Momentum (N-Day ROC)** | Rank assets by their N-day return and go long if return >0 (or top quantile), short if <0 (or bottom).                         | Look-back N days, quantile thresholds | Works across asset classes; robust in trending markets. | Requires rebalancing; drift in mean-reverting periods. |
| **Adaptive/Multi-EMA**               | Use multiple EMAs or an adaptive EMA (e.g. Kaufmanâ€™s AMA) to filter noise: enter when fast EMA crosses up slower/adaptive EMA. | Fast EMA, Slow EMA, Efficiency ratio  | Balances responsiveness and smoothing.                  | More parameters to optimize; complexity.               |
